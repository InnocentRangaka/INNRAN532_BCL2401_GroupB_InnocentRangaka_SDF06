## 6 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview

This project involved recreating a simplified Instagram profile page, with a focus on demonstrating my skills in CSS layout, styling, animation, and basic JavaScript functionality. I implemented various techniques to achieve a responsive design that adapts to different devices, while maintaining an aesthetically pleasing look and feel.

### Reflections

In this project, I challenged myself to recreate a simplified Instagram profile page using CSS. I explored various techniques to achieve a responsive layout, engaging animations, and interactive elements using JavaScript. The goal was to demonstrate my ability to create a visually appealing and functional user experience across different devices.

#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: I went from feeling comfortable with Flexbox to confidently wielding both Flexbox and Grid to create a sleek and organized layout especially my gallery. Aligning and distributing content using these techniques allowing me to achieve a modern and visually appealing design.
- **Responsive Design**: Implementing media queries and used viewport units to ensure smooth adaptation of the layout across desktop and mobile screens wasn't just a challenge, it was a learning opportunity. Now, I'm confident in creating layouts that look great on any device, thanks to my understanding of responsive design principles.
- **Styling Elements**: Going beyond basic visual styling, I recreated the look and feel of an Instagram profile, including the profile image, user information, and gallery section.

#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: Adjusting layouts and font sizes, and image sizes for various screens was challenging. I had to experiment with different approaches to ensure the design remained consistent and functional.
- **Image Fitting**: Implementing image resizing for smaller images using css was challenging and I used javascript to help fit images correctly.

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: I want to explore more advanced CSS properties and animations (scale and translate) to enhance the user experience.
- **Code Optimization**: I will  put focus on readability more.
- **Creative Design Choices**: I adhered closely to the Instagram layout for practice and I hope I will be able to create a move creative and interactive sites in future.

#### Overall Learning Experience

Great.
